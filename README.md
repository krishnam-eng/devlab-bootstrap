:thinking: **What's this**

_It consists of config files and more for my Linux setup and development environment._

To create an efficient Linux developer environment, it's a runbook to use to quickly customize and learn 'Tips n Tricks' of bash & zsh, nano, and various tools; to quickly install and configure required development tools.

:clap: **How it got created**

Learn, practice and check-in what-worked-well
* To learn the depth of Linux, shells, various dev tools capabilities in the context of dev productivity
* To capture 'Up n Running' & 'Tips n Tricks' along with the learning notes 

:rocket: **When to use**
* To manage personal customization to bash, zsh, nano configurations for boosting productivity. 
* To reuse the same config in any new Linux dev environment
