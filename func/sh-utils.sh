# P: Finding and Running Commands

# type command searches your environment (including aliases, keywords, functions, builtins, directories in $PATH, and the command hash table)
# which command is similar but only searches your $PATH
# apropos searches manpage names and descriptions for regular expressions supplied as arguments. This is incredibly useful when you don’t remember the name of the command you need.
#
# Option: -s search in manpages
