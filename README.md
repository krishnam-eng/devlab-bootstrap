:thinking: **What is this repo**
_Config files for my Linux setup and development environment._

* To manage personal customization to bash, zsh, nano configurations for boosting productivity. 
* To reuse the same config in any new dev env 

:clap: **Why**
* To learn the depth of Linux, shells, various dev tools capabilities in the context of dev productivity
* To capture 'up and running' & 'tips & tricks along with the learning notes 

:rocket:**When**
