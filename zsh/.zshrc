#               Globbing
#
# Basic
#      * - wildcard - any chars
#      ? - any single char        [ ls script.?? > script.sh
#     [] - bracket for a sequance of chars. supports char set also like [[:alpha:]]*
#      ^ - avoid [^o] - no o
# Extended
#    **/ - recursive searching in child dirs  [ **/*.md - it matchs all md files in child dir also
#   ***/ - recursive searching including links   [  ***/*.md - it matchs all md files including links
#    (|) - alternate pattern [  *.(bash|zsh) matchs both script files
#    <-> - numeric ranges    [ log_<10-20>.txt
#     ~  - should not match [ b*~*.o - file start with b and do nto have .o in it
#     ^  - caret and tilde does the same - operator for negating
# Qualifier
#     (/) - dir
#     (.) - file
#     (@) - link
#     (rwx) - read, write, execute
#     (o) - order n- name, L- size , m- modified
#     (O) - Reverse sort
#  Time Qualifier
#     (mh-1) -  modified in last 1h
#     (ch-1) -  created in last 1h
#     (ah-1) -  accessed in last 1h
#     h, m, w, M - hour, min, week, Month
# File Size Qualifier
#     (L[kmg][+-]size) kb, mb, gb, larger than, smaller than

#   The Zsh Line Editor allows you to define your own key bindings and set of custom keymaps (collections of key bindings) in addition to extending predefined entries.
#
# From EMACS Keybindings
#
# Move
#   Ctrl + A Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line
#   Ctrl + E Moves the cursor to the end of the line
#
#   Esc + B Moves the cursor backwards one word
#   Esc + F Moves the cursor forward one word
#
# Delete
#   Ctrl + U Deletes the whole line
#   Ctrl + K Kills (or deletes) until the end of the line
#
#   Esc + Backspace Deletes one word on the left of the cursor
#   Esc + D Deletes one word on the right of the cursor
#   Ctrl + W Deletes the whole word backwards from the cursor location
#
#   Ctrl + D Deletes a character (moves forward) / lists completions / logs out
#
# Yank
#   Ctrl + Y Yanks the last killed word
#   Esc + Y Switches the last yanked word
#
# Swap
#   Ctrl + T Transposes two characters
#   Esc + T Transposes two words
#
# Search
#   Ctrl + R Incremental search backwards
#   Ctrl + S Incremental search forwards (automatically enables NO_FLOW_CONTROL option)
#   Esc  + < go to very beginning of our history file
#
# Execute Mode
#  Esc + x  - open cmd mode: ctr+shit+p in vscode  or : in tmux
#     where-is mode
#
#  use `bindkey -L` to list all current bindings
#  todo: -L and find useful commands - take a print
